# What's New in Wunderlist
Changelog for the Mac app.

## 3.3.2

  - Fixed: Getting the spinning beach ball of death when checking off a to-do in a large shared list? We’ve popped that ball, and it should no longer be bouncing into your Wunderlist.
  - Fixed: As usual, we’ve fixed some crashes and minor bugs.
  - New: Feeling a little daring today? You can now mix up your hashtag styles with our added support for full-width hashtags. Yep, that’s right, you can now use # and ＃ as you tag your to-dos. Pretty exciting, right?!
  - New: Rydym bellach wedi ychwanegu Cymraeg at Wunderlist! Sicrhewch fod gosodiadau eich cyfrifiadur wedi'u gosod i Gymraeg, yna gallwch ddechrau cwblhau'r tasgau ar eich rhestr.
  - If you can understand that then you’ll realize that we’ve added Welsh to Wunderlist!
