# What's New in Wunderlist
Changelog for the Mac app.

## 3.4.2
- Users with many lists, we have squished the laggy bug that reappeared with the last update. It's now back to lightning fast speed.
- Fixed a bug when users would set a due date during the daylight time saving period and the due date would be one day prior to the selection

## 3.4.1
- Fixed: We like to save you time, which is why we’ve fixed the bug that meant that you had to click on a to-do before you could click on its link. 
- Fixed: If your app was crashing when you searched for unsynced to-dos, we’re sorry about that one. We’ve now sent that pesky bug to a galaxy far, far away. 
- Fixed: If you came across some strange options when right-clicking in a Smart List, then you’ll be glad to hear we’ve fixed that issue.
- Fixed: We went a bit avant-garde with some of our UI. Apparently the world is not quite ready for uncentered images so we tweaked a few minor UI issues in this update.
- Fixed: Were your due dates looking a bit weird when using the calendar in Japanese or Thai? Gomen'nasai (sorry)! We’ve fixed that strange bug.

## 3.4.0
- New: Add a to-do from either your list or from Quick Add (CTRL+ALT+W) and you will now get tag and assignee suggestions. Just type # to quickly choose from your most used tags, and @ to see and choose from all the people in your shared list. Assigned a to-do to someone by accident? Just hit the x at the top right of the Assigned to icon.
- New: Are Smart Due Dates occasionally being a little too clever for your liking? If you don’t want a due date to be created then simply hit ESC while typing to cancel the Smart Due Date.
- Fixed: GMT was having a magical effect on some of your to-dos and as you got further away from that time zone it was messing with your automatic reminders. We’ve fixed that now.
- Fixed: If you were experiencing slower sync then you’ll be glad to know we’ve fixed that issue.
- Fixed: Various bugs and minor improvements.

## 3.3.2

  - Fixed: Getting the spinning beach ball of death when checking off a to-do in a large shared list? We’ve popped that ball, and it should no longer be bouncing into your Wunderlist.
  - Fixed: As usual, we’ve fixed some crashes and minor bugs.
  - New: Feeling a little daring today? You can now mix up your hashtag styles with our added support for full-width hashtags. Yep, that’s right, you can now use # and ＃ as you tag your to-dos. Pretty exciting, right?!
  - New: Rydym bellach wedi ychwanegu Cymraeg at Wunderlist! Sicrhewch fod gosodiadau eich cyfrifiadur wedi'u gosod i Gymraeg, yna gallwch ddechrau cwblhau'r tasgau ar eich rhestr.
  - If you can understand that then you’ll realize that we’ve added Welsh to Wunderlist!

## 3.3.0

  - New: Download the update, hit CTRL+Option+W and behold the beauty of our new Quick Add and Search feature. It’s not just a pretty face though, behind that sleek exterior lives a very powerful mind. Click on the ‘+’ and you can quickly add a new to-do with Smart Due Dates*, such as ‘Tweet about how pretty the new Wunderlist update is today at 5pm’, a due date and reminder will automatically be added to your to-do without you having to move away from your keyboard. Now toggle across to the magnifying glass where you’ll find a mighty go-to and search function that lets you quickly go to one of your lists or a particular to-do. The best bit? You don’t even need the app to be your focus view for this to work. As you work through a document you can quickly add to-dos without getting distracted.
  - New: You won’t just find our Smart Due Dates* in Quick Add though. Every time you want to add a to-do in the app you will be able to type in when it’s due and Wunderlist will set the due date and reminder for you.
  - Improved: Do you have a million lists and can never find any of your to-dos? Well, we’ve improved our Search just for you. It’s now a lot faster and more accurate. On top of that, it will save your common search terms and you can choose whether you want to filter out your completed to-dos or not - just click on the dropdown next to the magnifying glass in the app’s search bar.
  - Fixed: We’ve cleaned out a few gremlins in the system including the one where our app crashed when you tried to open a file from the Quick Look screen.

## 3.2.0

  - If you’re a list-lover and sometimes find your Sidebar resembling an episode of Hoarders, you can now organize them into Folders by clicking and dragging one list onto another. Boom! Your Sidebar is now magically cleaner and super organized.
  - We’ve made your Wunderlist Sidebar supercalifragilisticexpialidocious by giving it a brand new design and a healthy dose of gorgeous color to make it easier to differentiate between your Folders, Lists, Inbox and Smart Lists.
  - And finally, we’re super happy to report back that the language switching bug that many of you were reporting has been apprehended by the authorities and won’t be making a ruckus anymore.

## 3.1.2

  - Capture your ideas, thoughts and reminders in an instant. No matter which app you’re using, when an idea strikes just type ⌥⇧W to use the brand new Quick Add widget. It lets you instantly add an Item to your Inbox along with a Reminder and Star.
  - In case you make a mistake in a Comment, you can now take back what you said because we’ve added the much requested ability to delete them. Just ⌥+click or two-finger tap on your trackpad.
  - And to round this update out, we put our mine-sweeper to work to find and remove a bunch of bugs for better performance.

## 3.1.0

  - As one of the first apps to fully support OS X Yosemite, we’re super excited to share what we’ve got in store for you!
  - Say hello to the Today widget. Whenever you need to know what’s on your agenda, simply open the Notification Center’s Today view, and you’ll find all your to-dos due today.
  - If you’re browsing the web with Safari — or other apps like Maps  — and come across something you want to keep or view later, just click on the share icon and Add to Wunderlist button to save it.
  - To perfectly match Yosemite’s redesigned interface we’ve refined every detail of Wunderlist for Mac’s design so your lists look stunningly beautiful. Plus, we’ve also optimized the code behind the app so everything feels incredibly smooth.
  - Wunderlist now fully supports Handoff. If you’re working on a list on your Mac, you can now pick up exactly where you left off on your iPhone or iPad when you head to a meeting.
  - We’ve also fixed a whole swathe of creepy-crawly bugs and made more stability improvements for you.
