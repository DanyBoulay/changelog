# What's New in Wunderlist
Changelog for the iOS app.

## 3.4.0

  - New: No your eyes aren’t deceiving you, we really are looking prettier today–thanks for noticing. Our brand new look has come to your iPhone and iPad. Your lists are even easier to see at a glance and we’ve streamlined the Detail View, to help make adding Reminders, Subtasks and Notes even faster.
  - New: Got a new iPhone 6s? You lucky thing. Say hello to our smart 3D Touch Peek, Pops and Quick Actions. When you press on the Wunderlist icon on your home screen, you’ll get two options—”Add to-do”, which lets you instantly jot down what’s on your mind, and “Due Today” to take you directly to your Today Smartlist so you can start checking off all of today’s to-dos.
  - New: Want to take a quick Peek inside a to-do? Use 3D Touch to see a preview of a to-do. Now swipe up while you’re in the Peek screen and you’ll be able to quickly reschedule it without even opening the Detail View. Press harder on the Peek screen and you’ll Pop straight into the Detail View, which is looking mighty pretty, we’re sure you’ll agree.
  - Fixed: We also toiled hard on fixing some minor bugs.

## 3.3.2

  - New: We’ve added in some extra emoji magic power! Put an emoji at the beginning of your list name and in a flash it becomes your list icon.  
  - New: We’ve tweaked the look and feel of our Due Dates and Reminders in the Detail View. Not only does it look nicer but we’ve also added an X button next to Due Dates and Reminders to let you quickly delete the date and time.
  - New: You can now log in with a Microsoft account. Simple.
  - New: We’re big fans of Smart Due Dates on Quick Add, but if you don’t like the text such as ‘today’ or ‘Jan’ disappearing then head to Settings–you can now disable Smart Due Dates.
  - Fixed: We’ve improved accessibility.
  - Fixed: Want your sync to be faster than lightning fast? Ok! We’ve made a ton of sync performance improvements.
  - Fixed: We’ve fixed a bunch of bugs including issues with Automatic Reminders and the upcoming version of iOS.
