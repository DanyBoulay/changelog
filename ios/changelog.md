# What's New in Wunderlist
Changelog for the iOS app.

## 3.4.1

  - Fixed: Links in comments are clickable again
  - Fixed: Due dates would show up wrongly when using Japanese calendar
  - Fixed: Icons on iPad Pro aren't blurry
  - Fixed: Pull to Sync animation in Week and Completed smart list is broken

## 3.4.0

  - New: No your eyes aren’t deceiving you, we really are looking prettier today–thanks for noticing. Our brand new look has come to your iPhone and iPad. Your lists are even easier to see at a glance and we’ve streamlined the Detail View, to help make adding Reminders, Subtasks and Notes even faster.
  - New: Got a new iPhone 6s? You lucky thing. Say hello to our smart 3D Touch Peek, Pops and Quick Actions. When you press on the Wunderlist icon on your home screen, you’ll get two options—”Add to-do”, which lets you instantly jot down what’s on your mind, and “Due Today” to take you directly to your Today Smartlist so you can start checking off all of today’s to-dos.
  - New: Want to take a quick Peek inside a to-do? Use 3D Touch to see a preview of a to-do. Now swipe up while you’re in the Peek screen and you’ll be able to quickly reschedule it without even opening the Detail View. Press harder on the Peek screen and you’ll Pop straight into the Detail View, which is looking mighty pretty, we’re sure you’ll agree.
  - Fixed: We also toiled hard on fixing some minor bugs.

## 3.3.2

  - New: We’ve added in some extra emoji magic power! Put an emoji at the beginning of your list name and in a flash it becomes your list icon.  
  - New: We’ve tweaked the look and feel of our Due Dates and Reminders in the Detail View. Not only does it look nicer but we’ve also added an X button next to Due Dates and Reminders to let you quickly delete the date and time.
  - New: You can now log in with a Microsoft account. Simple.
  - New: We’re big fans of Smart Due Dates on Quick Add, but if you don’t like the text such as ‘today’ or ‘Jan’ disappearing then head to Settings–you can now disable Smart Due Dates.
  - Fixed: We’ve improved accessibility.
  - Fixed: Want your sync to be faster than lightning fast? Ok! We’ve made a ton of sync performance improvements.
  - Fixed: We’ve fixed a bunch of bugs including issues with Automatic Reminders and the upcoming version of iOS.

## 3.2.4

  - New: We’ve updated our Apple Watch Glance. We listened when you said that you wanted more than one to-do on your Glance. Not only will you now get 3-4 to-dos but you also get a fancy circle in the corner. As you complete your to-dos for the day the circle will also complete, giving you a nice visual of how much you have left to do… or how far you’ve come.
  - New: We’ve updated our app so that we can be here to help everyone with sight impairments. It might not be able to chat to you about the weather but, with the accessibility settings turned on on your iPhone, Wunderlist can now talk to you and tell you what lists and to-dos you have.
  - Fixed: Our app was being a bit greedy with your cellular data, we’ve now fixed the issue with high network data usage that some of you were experiencing.
  - Fixed: We’ve fixed our Apple Watch app, so that it won’t unexpectedly crash on you as you tick off your groceries at the supermarket.
  - Fixed: For some of you the app was freezing when it launched. We’ve now zapped that bug.

## 3.2.3

  - We’ve added ContextKit which means that the natural language on Quick Add on your iPhone has been improved, it also allows us to keep improving it in future updates.
  - Now when you tap on one notification in your Notification Center you will still be able to see the others (we previously removed all of them) so you can work your way through each notification in your own time.
  - If you decide that you’ve completed the to-do while you’re still looking at your Notification Center then we’ve made a slight bug fix so that it says when you completed the to-do. It’s the small things.
  - And if you forget how many notifications you have then our Icon Badge will now update without needing to have the app open.
  - Still have an iPod? Good news! We’ve removed the requirement for a camera so now you can get productive while listening to your jams.
  - Upgraded your iPod to an iPhone 6? Your backgrounds have had a slight tweak so that they’ll look prettier on your screen.
  - Had a few notifications even though your push notifications are turned off? Whoops, we’re sorry about that and have fixed the bug that was bothering you unnecessarily.
  - Conversely, if you weren’t getting the notifications you wanted, you will now.
  - We’re all fans of Quick Add here, right? So that bug that hid the Quick Add button sometimes was pretty annoying. We’ve now squashed it.
  - Otherwise, there should be less crashes and improved detail view performance as well as some iOS 8.3 compatibility issues fixed.

## 3.2.2

  - Wunderlist for Apple Watch is here! As your most personal to-do list yet, it intelligently puts your lists, agenda, and reminders right on your wrist to help you get stuff done on the go. To help show what’s most important to you, we’ve designed a very special Home View for Wunderlist for Apple Watch. From here you can quickly get to all of your most important to-dos via your Smart Lists and if you need to access a specific list, just scroll down using the Digital Crown. Wunderlist for Apple Watch also helps keep you in the loop and on top of your to-dos with Reminders, a Glance of your Today Smart List and notifying you as soon as a colleague or friend shares a list with you.

## 3.2.0

  - If you’re a list-lover and sometimes find your Sidebar resembling an episode of Hoarders, you can now organize them into Folders by tapping, holding and dragging one list onto another. Boom! Your Homescreen is now magically cleaner and super organized.
  - In the middle of your Homescreen, there’s a friendly new blue circle called Quick Add that we’d like you to meet. It’s here to help you can instantly add a to-do or a new list with just one tap. It’s super intelligent too, because Quick Add can automatically create a Reminder and Due Date as you type or speak.
  - We’ve made your Sidebar supercalifragilisticexpialidocious by giving it a brand new design and a healthy dose of gorgeous color to make it easier to differentiate between your Folders, Lists, Inbox and Smart Lists.

## 3.1.6

  - If you have a love-hate relationship with passwords like we do (the love comes from keeping stuff secure), you’ll be happy to hear that in addition to 1Password support, you can now also use iCloud Keychain to quickly sign in.
  - In case you make a mistake in a Comment, you can now take back what you said. Just long-press to delete your Comments.
  - We’ve made our sharing extension, Add to Wunderlist, even better so you can more easily add items to Wunderlist from your other favorite apps.
  - And to round this update out, we put our mine-sweeper to work to find and remove a bunch of bugs for better performance.

## 3.1.3

  - To round out the launch of Discover for Public Lists, we’ve added a brand new publishing flow. You can now personalize your Public Lists by adding a cover photo, description, and category right from your iPhone and iPad. Just tap the globe icon in the Action Bar of your curated list to see it in action.
  - For those of you who get a lot of notifications throughout the day, we removed the vibration to quieten things down.
  - We brought out our butterfly net to track down some small but buggy bugs too:
  - Some of you were experience app crashes when using 1Password to sign in, so we’re happy to let you know that the ride is cadillac-smooth again.
  - Reminders that thought they were Dolly the sheep and started cloning themselves, now only appear once.
  - And finally, we made some behind-the-scenes changes to the Today widget to improve auto-updating for you.

## 3.1.2

  - Don’t like forgetting your passwords? We’ve added support for 1Password to make signing into Wunderlist easier and more secure. Once you’ve downloaded 1Password, just tap the icon when signing in.
  - One of your most requested features is here in ‘beta’ form... You can now see your to-dos in iCal. Just head to the App Settings > Your Details and tap on the Calendar Feed URL. Currently the feed only syncs one way, but we’re already working on a bunch of improvements for the next update.
  - Some of you were told us that signing in on your iPad caused some UI issues, so you’ll be happy to hear that everything’s been polished up to look spick and span again.
  - There’s also a handful of other smaller bug fixes coming your way in this update, like improved Today widget & Add to Wunderlist support for all languages and improvements to Facebook sign in.

## 3.1.1

  - Dropbox support is here! You can now add any of your Dropbox files to your to-dos for free. Just tap on the paperclip in the Detail View, then tap on ‘Dropbox’ and select your file. We’ll then add the Dropbox link to your to-do and instantly sync it across your phone, tablet and computer too.
  - Now when you sign up with Google+, we automatically put a face to your name, using your profile picture.
  - We’ve whipped out our infamous magnifying glass to tweak those Retina HD pixels to make the Items in your lists look even better.
  - If you’re into manually syncing, you’ll see that we’ve fixed the position of the spinning cloud.
  - And finally, if you’ve sent in a crash report lately, thanks so much for your help in making Wunderlist better. We’ve got fixes for many of them coming your way.
