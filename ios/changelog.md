# What's New in Wunderlist
Changelog for the iOS application.

## 3.3.2

  - New: We’ve added in some extra emoji magic power! Put an emoji at the beginning of your list name and in a flash it becomes your list icon.  
  - New: We’ve tweaked the look and feel of our Due Dates and Reminders in the Detail View. Not only does it look nicer but we’ve also added an X button next to Due Dates and Reminders to let you quickly delete the date and time.
  - New: You can now log in with a Microsoft account. Simple.
  - New: We’re big fans of Smart Due Dates on Quick Add, but if you don’t like the text such as ‘today’ or ‘Jan’ disappearing then head to Settings–you can now disable Smart Due Dates.
  - Fixed: We’ve improved accessibility.
  - Fixed: Want your sync to be faster than lightning fast? Ok! We’ve made a ton of sync performance improvements.
  - Fixed: We’ve fixed a bunch of bugs including issues with Automatic Reminders and the upcoming version of iOS.
