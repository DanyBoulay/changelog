# What's New in Wunderlist
Changelog for the Web, Chrome, and Windows 7 applications.

## 3.12.9

  - We've stopped patching task positions unnecessarily when you tick off a to-do. What does this mean for you? Just that your Wunderlist will be running more smoothly when you tick off recurring to-dos.

## 3.12.8

  - We've disabled the option to Duplicate your List while searching because, if we're honest, it didn't make much sense.
  - Were visual glitches causing you to wonder if you were in the Matrix? We've now fixed the glitches, and can assure you that you weren't. Would you mind just taking this blue pill?
  - We've updated our translations.
  - Click on the 3 dots within a list and you'll find our Delete Selected To-do option. You might have noticed that it was showing up when no to-dos were selected though. We've fixed that bug. 
  - If you were having issues switching between Search and add a to-do you'll be pleased to hear that we've fixed that pesky little bug. 
  - Talking of switching‚Äîif you like to switch between languages on your Wunderlist you may have noticed that the Title bar was expressing a little reluctance about changing to the new language. We've given it a talking to and it will now change as soon as you switch languages.
  - If you had an extra long title for your to-do something went a little funny when you tried to use @ to assign a to-do. We've fixed that little quirk.

## 3.12.7

  - If your Wunderlist was kicking up a fuss and freezing when you tried to delegate your to-dos to someone else you'll be happy to hear that this is now fixed. You can now delegate to your heart's content.
  - In Safari we fixed the position of the Close Note icon. 
  - We also fixed a couple of UI issues for both Safari and Edge.
  - Prefer checking off your to-dos with a pen? We've fixed issues with printing in Firefox and Edge. 
  - Wunderlist really, really liked files with long names so it stopped letting you delete them for a while. We've worked on its attachment issues and you can now delete all your files.

## 3.12.6

  - A simple update this time‚Äîwe've fixed the issue where some popovers where getting stuck open.

## 3.12.5

  - Some of the formating of printing went a little funny with the last update. We've fixed it so it looks just as it should. 

## 3.12.4

  - We updated some design elements to keep Wunderlist looking ever so stylish.
  - We fixed an issue that caused your to-do to break when you tried to delegate by typing @. 
  - The click targets for expanding a Folder were fixed.
  - If you logged out there were occasionally issues with not being redirected properly. We took care of that bug.
  - You might have noticed that you had problems renaming or ungrouping your Folders in Safari. We've made the 3 dots clickable now.
  - Our search icon was getting a little too cosy with the hamburger icon. We've had to separate them.
  - The layout of Reminders was fixed.

## 3.12.3

  - Everyone loves emojis, right? We love them too so we were aghast to see that they weren't rendering correctly in the Detail View footer on a shared list. We fixed it pronto. üëè
  - We optimized how task counts are rendered.
  - A number of miscellaneous bugs were fixed.
  - There was an issue with dragging and dropping your to-dos between Lists in Smart Lists. We fixed that one.

## 3.12.1

  - We now support Welsh! Just change the language in your Account Settings.
  - We polished up some of the design.
  - If you're resizing your browser window you'll notice that the sidebar now auto collapses.
  - We fixed a bunch of Smart Due Date issues including adding more support for different date formats, and fixing bugs for Chinese and Japanese users. 
  - If you had a long file name you might have noticed it colliding with the delete icon. They shall crash together no longer.

## 3.12.0

  - If you like to use a lot of tags but also like to keep your Wunderlist in a small browser window then this update will help you make more sense of your to-dos. Tags will now auto collapse when in a small browser window and you can see the detail of the tags when you hover over them.
  - When you change your password we'll now let you know straight away if we don't approve of your password. 
  - We've increased the print font size so you can see your to-dos more easily.
  - If you change your language settings the date picker will now update too.
  - With autocomplete for tags or assigning, you'll now find it easier to navigate through the list with your keyboard. 
  - We know that forgetting your password can be pretty frustrating and being faced with a blank screen when you hit 'Forgot Password' is doubly frustrating which is why we fixed that issue quick smart!
  - We fixed search results not always rendering their list headings when updates were received from the sync.
  - Your Completed Smart List should now be sorted by completion date.
  - Unwanted escaping when you duplicated a list was fixed.
  - Emojis on your to-dos might have been looking a bit funny but we've fixed it so that they'll no longer get cut off.
  - We've fixed keyboard navigation for right-to-left languages.
  - Imagine a country where the time format starts with minutes instead of hours. Can't? That's because it doesn't exist. We fixed our reminder picer so that it no longer shows this imaginary time format. 
  - Our AM/PM dropdown inside the reminder calendar was a little too narrow for Hebrew, so we widened it.
  - The detail view icons were a little misplaced for right-to-left languages, we did a little rearranging.
  - We fixed the issue of not being able to view or download invoices.
  - If you have an emoji in your name then it might not have been showing up correctly in the Detail View... until now.
  - When there's a sync error you should see a small (yet dramatic) red lightning bolt. We fixed a bug that was making it less dramatic than we wanted.
  - We fixed subtasks not always rendering links in text.
